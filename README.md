# ToolX

ToolX is simple and easy to understand but in case this is not the case for you ... :
Multiple choices are made with what is between brackets for example,

  [1] Spammer
  
  [2] Deleter
  
  [3] Change color
  
  Choice -> "your choice"
  
if I want to choose to change the color I will simply write "3" and press enter
but if I want to use the spam function I will write "1" and press enter.

That's all, the rest will be well explained
